NV_IS_LONG_DOUBLE        : Automatically defined by Makefile.PL iff
                           $Config{nvtype} is 'long double'.

NV_IS_FLOAT128           : Automatically defined by Makefile.PL iff
                           $Config{nvtype} is __float128
                           If NV_IS_FLOAT128 is defined we include the
                           quadmath.h header.

MPFR_WANT_FLOAT128       : Defined by Makefile.PL if $have_float128 is
                           set to a true value. $have_float128 can be set
                           to a true value by either editing the Makefile.PL
                           appropriately or by specifying F128=1 in the
                           Makefile.PL's @ARGV.
                           The quadmath.h header is included if this symbol
                           is defined.
                           NOTE: If MPFR_WANT_FLOAT128 is defined, it is
                           assumed that the mpfr library was built with
                           __float128 support - ie was configured with the
                           '--enable-float128' option.
                           MPFR_WANT_FLOAT128 must NOT be defined if the
                           mpfr library has NOT been built with __float128
                           support.
                           MPFR_WANT_FLOAT128 does not imply that NV_IS_FLOAT128
                           has been defined - perhaps we have defined
                           MPFR_WANT_FLOAT128 solely because we wish to make
                           use of the Math::Float128-Math::MPFR interface.

MPC_CAN_PASS_FLOAT128        : Defined only when both MPFR_WANT_FLOAT128 and
                           NV_IS_FLOAT128 is defined, and then only if the mpfr
                           library is at version 4.0.0 or later. (There was no
                           __float128 support in the mpfr library prior to
                           4.0.0.)
                           DANGER: The assumption is that if MPFR_WANT_FLOAT128
                           is defined then the mpfr library has been built
                           with __float128 support, which won't be the case if
                           the mpfr library wasn't configured with
                           '--enable-float128'.
                           I haven't yet found a way of managing this - it's
                           instead left up to the person building Math::MPFR to
                           NOT define MATH_MPFR_WANT_FLOAT128 unless mpfr WAS
                           configured with --enable-float128.


MATH_MPC_NEED_LONG_LONG_INT
                         : Defined by Makefile.PL if
                           $Config{ivsize} >= 8 && $Config{ivtype} is not
                           'long' && $use_64_bit_int (in the Makefile.PL)
                           has not been set to -1. This symbol will also be
                           defined if $use_64_bit_int is set to 1.
                           The setting of this symbol is taken to imply that
                           the mpc/mpfr _uj/_sj functions are needed for
                           converting mpfr integer values to perl integers.
                           Conversely, if the symbol is not defined, then
                           the implication is that the _uj/sj functions are
                           not needed (because the _ui/_si functions, which
                           are alway available) provide the same
                           functionality) - and therefore those _uj/_sj
                           functions are then not made available.

_WIN32_BIZARRE_INFNAN    : Defined (on Windows only) when the perl version
                           (as expressed by $]) is less than 5.022.
                           These earlier perl versions generally stringified
                           NaNs as (-)1.#IND and (-)1.#INF.

_Complex_I               : Defined by complex.h. Attempts to define _DO_COMPLEX
                           (see below) will not succeed if _Complex_I is not
                           defined.

_DO_COMPLEX              : Automatically defined if at least one of Math::Complex_C,
                           Math::Complex_C::L and Math::Complex_C::Q is installed.
                           complex.h will be included iff _DO_COMPLEX is defined.
                           Can also be defined in the Makefile.PL by setting
                           $do_complex_h to 1 - though I can't envisage a situation
                           where doing so will be advantageous.
                           (Will be automatically undefined if _Complex_I is not
                           defined following the inclusion of complex.h.)
